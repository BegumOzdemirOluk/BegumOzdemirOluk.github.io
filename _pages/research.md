**Carbon Neutrality and Transparency: Evidence from a Choice Experiment** (Job Market Paper) 

**Abstract:**
<p>This paper focuses on the impact of transparency in carbon-neutral labeling on consumer preferences and willingness to pay in a market with a proliferation of various climate labels. These labels, despite representing different concepts, may lead to consumer confusion due to their overlapping characteristics. Theoretical evidence suggests that an abundance of labels might promote those with lower environmental quality. The study aims to address whether providing detailed information on the percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> offsetting and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction on carbon-neutral labels influences consumer preferences. I conduct a discrete choice experiment among UK tea consumers through an online survey. I use a split samples approach, comparing responses to standard and "transparent" carbon-neutral labels that disclose specific CO<sub>2</sub> offsetting and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction percentages.</p>

**Abstract:** 
<p>Corporate social responsibility and the private provision of (global) public goods are of key interest to economists and policymakers alike. Increasingly, private companies are making their operations carbon neutral, often leading their own products to also be certified accordingly. It is an empirical question how consumers value carbon-neutral products and how informed they are about them, which we address as follows. First, we provide a meta-analysis of the literature analyzing demand for products with carbon-neutral labels, based on an overall sample of 27,241 participants. In this analysis, the focus is on average willingness to pay for carbon reductions as well as on the characteristics of the underlying literature, including the use of stated preferences and population samples, and their association with willingness to pay. Second, we leverage information on prices and product characteristics from one of the largest online marketplaces, Amazon's, to infer from revealed preferences on consumers' valuation of carbon-neutral products, through a hedonic approach. The staggered process of carbon-neutral certification leads to a series of quasi-natural experiments, which we use for identification purposes. We find that the literature, which is mainly based on survey studies, suggests a positive willingness to pay for carbon neutrality of products that exceeds most estimates of the social cost of carbon. However, this finding is not supported by the hedonic approach, which is based on market prices, where we do not find evidence for a positive willingness to pay for carbon neutrality for a wide range of products sold on Amazon.</p>
