Carbon Neutrality and Transparency: Evidence from a Choice Experiment (Job Market Paper) 

**Abstract:**
<p>This paper focuses on the impact of transparency in carbon-neutral labeling on consumer's preferences and willingness to pay. In current markets, there is a proliferation of various climate labels representing different concepts but overlapping characteristics, which may lead to consumer confusion. Theoretical evidence suggests that an abundance of labels might promote those with lower environmental quality. At the same time, providing additional information on the labels could potentially increase existing consumer confusion. Therefore, this study aims to address whether providing information on the percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) offsetting and GHG reduction on carbon-neutral labels influences consumer preferences. I conduct a discrete choice experiment among UK tea consumers through an online survey. I use a split sample approach, comparing consumers' willingness to pay for standard carbon-neutral labels and 'transparent' carbon-neutral labels, which additionally disclose the percentage of GHG offsetting and GHG reduction. Furthermore, I examine the effect of various factors, including concerns about carbon offsetting, trust, and confusion, on consumers' preferences for standard and transparent carbon-neutral labels. </p>

**Abstract:** 
<p>Corporate social responsibility and the private provision of (global) public goods are of key interest to economists and policymakers alike. Increasingly, private companies are making their operations carbon neutral, often leading their own products to also be certified accordingly. It is an empirical question how consumers value carbon-neutral products and how informed they are about them, which we address as follows. First, we provide a meta-analysis of the literature analyzing demand for products with carbon-neutral labels, based on an overall sample of 27,241 participants. In this analysis, the focus is on average willingness to pay for carbon reductions as well as on the characteristics of the underlying literature, including the use of stated preferences and population samples, and their association with willingness to pay. Second, we leverage information on prices and product characteristics from one of the largest online marketplaces, Amazon's, to infer from revealed preferences on consumers' valuation of carbon-neutral products, through a hedonic approach. The staggered process of carbon-neutral certification leads to a series of quasi-natural experiments, which we use for identification purposes. We find that the literature, which is mainly based on survey studies, suggests a positive willingness to pay for carbon neutrality of products that exceeds most estimates of the social cost of carbon. However, this finding is not supported by the hedonic approach, which is based on market prices, where we do not find evidence for a positive willingness to pay for carbon neutrality for a wide range of products sold on Amazon.</p>
