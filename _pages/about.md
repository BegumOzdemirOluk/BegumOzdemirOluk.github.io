I received my B.A. in Psychology from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) (Turkey) with a minor in Philosophy in 2016. Then, I received my Ph.D. degree in Psychology from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2022. During my Ph.D., I was associated with [the Center for Perceptual Systems](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cps/) (specifically Geisler lab) and conducted my graduate studies under the supervision of [Prof.Wilson Geisler](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/wsg8). 

My graduate work is primarily concerned with the perception of the 3D slant and visual target detection under uncertainty (see [here](https://canoluk.github.io/research/) for more details). In my graduate work, I especially focused on computational modeling (image processing models), specifically the derivation and implementation of Bayesian ideal observers. Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf). In the future, I am planning to focus more on the theoretical and computational aspects of visual processing (some of my research interests can be found [here](https://canoluk.github.io/research/)).
