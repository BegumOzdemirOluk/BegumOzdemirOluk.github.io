I am a doctoral candidate at (the University of St. Gallen)[https://www.unisg.ch/en/] and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology ((Eawag)[https://www.eawag.ch/en/]). I am affiliated with the Environmental Economics ((EnvEco) [https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/ess/main-focus/environmental-economics-enveco/]) group within Eawag, and the Swiss Institute for International Economics and Applied Economic Research ((SIAW)[https://siaw.unisg.ch/en]) within the University of St.Gallen. My primary research interests involves environmental economics, environmental valuation, and behavioral economics. 

My dissertation project focuses on (understanding consumersâ€™ demand for carbon-neutral products and services)[https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/ess/projects/understanding-the-demand-for-carbon-neutral-products-and-services/], thereby examining the private provision of a global public good in relation to climate change mitigation efforts. The objective is to understand the factors influencing consumers' willingness to pay for climate-friendly products, as well as to obtain methodological insights into the extent of hypothetical bias within stated preference methods. To achieve this, my research employs a combination of field experiments, quasi-experimental approaches, and a meta-analyses.
