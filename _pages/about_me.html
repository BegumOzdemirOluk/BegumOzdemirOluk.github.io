<p>I am a doctoral candidate at the University of St. Gallen (<a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/" target="_blank">HSG</a>) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank">Eawag</a>). I am affiliated with the Environmental Economics (<a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/ess/main-focus/environmental-economics-enveco/" target="_blank">EnvEco</a>) group within Eawag, and the Swiss Institute for International Economics and Applied Economic Research (<a href="https://siaw.unisg.ch/en" target="_blank">SIAW</a>) within HSG. I have obtained a B.Sc. degree in Management, with a specialized focus on Finance, and an M.A. degree in Economics from Bilkent University, Turkey. Furthermore, I hold an M.S. degree in Economics, and a minor in Mathematics, from the University of North Texas, United States.</p> 

<p>My primary research interests involve environmental and behavioral economics. <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/ess/projects/understanding-the-demand-for-carbon-neutral-products-and-services/" target="_blank">My dissertation project</a> focuses on understanding consumersâ€™ demand for carbon-neutral products and services, thereby examining the private provision of a global public good in relation to climate change mitigation efforts. The objective is to understand the factors influencing consumers' willingness to pay for climate-friendly products, as well as to obtain methodological insights into the extent of hypothetical bias within stated preference methods. To achieve this, my research leverages a combination of a meta-analysis, quasi-experimental approaches, and a stated preference survey.</p>
