    I am a doctoral candidate at the University of St. Gallen (<a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">HSG</a>), where my research is funded by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">Eawag</a>). I am affiliated with the Swiss Institute for International Economics and Applied Economic Research (<a href="https://siaw.unisg.ch/en" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">SIAW-HSG</a>).

    My research lies at the intersection of environmental and behavioral economics. My dissertation project</a> examines consumer demand for carbon-neutral products, investigating the private provision of global public goods in the context of climate change mitigation.

    Methodologically, I use meta-analysis, quasi-experimental approaches, and stated preference surveys.
