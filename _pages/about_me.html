  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    I am a doctoral candidate at the University of St. Gallen (<a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">HSG</a>), where my research is funded by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">Eawag</a>). I am affiliated with the Swiss Institute for International Economics and Applied Economic Research (<a href="https://siaw.unisg.ch/en" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">SIAW-HSG</a>).

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    I hold a B.Sc. in Management with a specialization in Finance and an M.A. in Economics from Bilkent University, Turkey, as well as an M.S. in Economics and a minor in Mathematics from the University of North Texas.

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    My research lies at the intersection of environmental and behavioral economics. <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/ess/projects/understanding-the-demand-for-carbon-neutral-products-and-services/" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: none;">My dissertation project</a> examines consumer demand for carbon-neutral products, investigating the private provision of global public goods in the context of climate change mitigation. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Methodologically, I employ meta-analysis, quasi-experimental approaches, and stated preference surveys to understand how individuals make environmental choices and respond to climate policy interventions.
