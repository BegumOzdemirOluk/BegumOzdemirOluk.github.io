<p>I am a doctoral candidate at the University of St. Gallen (<a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/" target="_blank">HSG</a>). My PhD is funded by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank">Eawag</a>). I am affiliated with the Swiss Institute for International Economics and Applied Economic Research (<a href="https://siaw.unisg.ch/en" target="_blank">SIAW</a>) at HSG. I hold a B.Sc. in Management (Finance specialization) and an M.A. in Economics from Bilkent University, Turkey, as well as an M.S. in Economics and a minor in Mathematics from the University of North Texas, United States.</p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of environmental and behavioral economics. <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/ess/projects/understanding-the-demand-for-carbon-neutral-products-and-services/" target="_blank">My dissertation project</a> studies consumers’ demand for carbon-neutral products, focusing on the private provision of a global public good in the context of climate change mitigation. Methodologically, I use a meta-analysis, quasi-experimental approaches, and a stated preference survey.</p>
